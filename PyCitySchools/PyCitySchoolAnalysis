It was noted that schools with higher budgets did not yield better test results. 
By contrast, schools with higher spending per student ($645-$675) performed lower that schools with smaller budgets 
(less than $585 per student)

Smaller and medium sized schools performed better than large sized schools on passing math performances 
(89-91% passing vs 67%).

Charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics which may be due to the fact 
that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school.

Passing reading grades were higher than math skills for all schools.

This analysis does not contain information about student-teacher ratio, students intelligence level, or backgrounds 
that could ultimately affect their overall test scores.
